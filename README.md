# Population genetic simulation: Benchmarking frameworks for non-standard models of natural selection

This repository contains the code to replicate the benchmarking conducted in the aforementioned article. 

To run, clone the repository, and execute the [run_benchmarking.py](run_benchmarking.py) script. This will run all the simulations and generate the data for the burn-in, the forward simulation, and the analysis. 

Figures can be recreated using the [benchmarking_plots.R](benchmarking_plots.R) script. Significance tests and collation of the files created during the simulations are also included in this script.
